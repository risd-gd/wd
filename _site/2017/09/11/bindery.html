## Crowdsourcing design manifesto

Share your writing via Google Docs. Let's read and see what our points are.

## John Marion on I Voted Sticker

John is a lobbyist working to better voting access and policies in Rhode Island. He recently posted a [tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnMarionjr/status/918881704147914752) asking for a I Voted RI sticker. Let's have a conversation exploring the role of the sticker in an 'early voting' culture — might the sticker move into the Web space as well? As an avatar, etc. John may can give us a window into how the sticker has worked in the past, who still doesn't vote, and more.

Based on the above conversation, design something in the next week that furthers the effort to get people out to the polls.

### Add to Untitled Park post

## Presentations
* Put in GitHub

## Final project

### Digital to physical
Can the Web, a "fast" medium (low effort, high volume), lead to "slower" more meaningful interactions/investments from constituents? In other words, how might the Web get someone off their screen and put their body alongside of others? Can the Web encourage participation from communities that tend to not participate in governance?


### Discussion, Conversation and Debate

140 characters plus the like button have destroyed debate on the Internet. Early blogging felt more like publishing. How do we of differing opinions discuss now? How do you change someone's mind? Can the Web facilitate this discussion, perhaps make the face-to-face discussion more palatable when it does happen? How do concerns over privacy affect free and open discussion?* Four classes left thereafter: Nov 6, Nov 13, Nov 27, Dec 4

### Open

Propose a project based on the concepts accrued so far in the course.

### Write:
Take a position: write a single page of text with your position on crowdsourcing. Is it ever acceptable to crowd-source designs or to have the masses vote on designs created by discrete entities? Do your own reading as well. We will synthesize your writing into a single manifesto for posting. Put your writing in paragraphs where each paragraph is a point you're trying to make.

### Add to Untitled Park post

## Presentations
* Put in GitHub

## Upcoming
* Garnering participation / Digital to Physical / Discussion platforms as additional themes
* Oct. 30: Visit by John Marion of [Common Cause RI](http://commoncauseri.org/) and Jodi Leo on a digital "I voted" sticker
* Four classes left thereafter: Nov 6, Nov 13, Nov 27, Dec 4

# Welcome to Rhode Island Park
	        	  
		        		## Project 1 critique


## Design Office presentation

* I'll talk about the DO
* We'll walk to City Hall
* We'll stop into the DO 



## Unit 2: From private to public

Capitalism and democracy are strange bedfellows. Capitalism collects wealth and power, with that power seeking growth at all costs. In this unit, we seek how to divert our consumptive and creative attention away from private interests to the common good – to public interests. What can be learned from the tremendous innovation being funded by the private sector? How might innovations meant for ease and commerce be diverted into the social good in the form of tools, systems, and the like?

#### Readings/References

### Week 4: Oct 2, 2017

* Review  *Project 1*
* Discuss unit 2

Project Two: Visit the Providence City Council and propose a project based on the meeting. There are many things you could do (from augmented reality layers, to getting more people to attend, etc). Given the unit quesetion, consider how what the private sector has learned might work for the public.

### Week 4: Oct 9, 2017
* Share your findings from the Council meeting. Revise for next week.

	        	  
		        		## Introductory matter

* GitHub (everyone signs up and is added to repo, downloads app)
* Review open data assignment; Progress on larger site
* Look at Doc on who is presenting. [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAJ9aUnOGOpoQdGYAhQdMmB9MGnQWZS3hA7caDqpt0s/edit)
* Our list of public names should continue, as it can be a publishable list by the class. [Add here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVYmPPERzy-PtCRwVjiVq2YaQQgL6DIRCCJAnx02W44/edit).
* Review progress on assignments


##### For next week

* Finish project one. Also potentially work with Web Standards Framework.


##### 11am Guest & In-Class Activity

* Danny Chapman on accessibility. Design a voter information guide using Web Standards framework. How might it "continue" to inform after the election?

### Lecture Notes

Accessiblity is:
* Motor skills limitations
* Color contrast
* No vision
* Deaf/low hearing

1998: Section 508.
* Extend civil rights to those with disabilities. Should also apply to Technology

iPhone release 2007
* Helped kill Flash

Web Standards Project
HTML5 brought in new tags

Traditional stack worked for awhile.
Single page app has made this problematic.

Angularjs and React

To Do:

Read 508 checklist
- 18f has one
- Use alt tags for images
- BE careful with the HTML source order for your content
- Use HTML as baseline
- Use accessible color schemes
- Don't rely on color, imagery, icons as sole way to convey meaning
- Use basic HTML elements as intended
- Use HTML 5
- Use ARIA
- Use USDS Web Standards as starting point.

Austomated Testing tools
- WAVE accessibility
- Chrome Accessibilty Tools
- aXe plug-in
- Safari dev tools (turing off style sheets)

Try site out with a screen reader
- Mac has built-in one. System Prefs>Accessibility>VoiceOver

Google Lighthouse tool - accessibility, performance.

Test your writing
- Hemingway editor

A11yBos is a group in Boston. Find a person, test.

WCAG 2 is an international spec on accessibility

Consider bandwidth, page weight and performance as it relates to rural, low bandwidth, lower income or crisis situations.

Don't wait until you are done building to think about accessibility

## Research projects

Each of you was asked to choose an organization from a provided list (or suggest another) and make a presentation via a website by a date chosen in week 2. [Here is the link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAJ9aUnOGOpoQdGYAhQdMmB9MGnQWZS3hA7caDqpt0s/edit)

## Public list

Our list of public names should continue, as it can be a publishable list by the class. [Add here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVYmPPERzy-PtCRwVjiVq2YaQQgL6DIRCCJAnx02W44/edit).

## Review of projects

We'll have about 1.5 hours to discuss in-progress projects. Let's divy up that time and have everyone discuss what site they chose and why, and what ideas are developing for the web.

* Democracy only relevant if there are shared 'things'. Honig reading.

## 11am talk and activity by Ryan Laughlin

* Either take some thing from Providence Open Data and turn it into a form that people would benefit from or collect data from your public site and imagine it on the site. Create your own data source that tells something about the community you live in. Notes from Ryan's talk [are here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jijVHS26I8N6fA0f3eTxPsrd9vyKLGmXv7dL1GyiZ7o/edit?usp=sharing)

Let’s use <a href="http://are.na">arena</a>, yes? What do we want in our GitHub repo? As a browsable site? Does majority rule?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unit-1-public-sites">Unit 1: Public sites</h2>

<p>Every group shares objects, space, etc — a resource is called ‘public’ when it refers to something state-owned. How the group manages its resources and tends to what is common is critical to the vitality of the group. Democracy is an ideal system of government, but it is rarely justly applied. Who occupies public space in the U.S. has always been contentious. This unit seeks to understand the state of our public possessions, in Providence specifically, and a desire to invest everyone within them. An abandonment of what is public is an abandonment of what holds the group together.</p>

<h3 id="week-1">Week 1</h3>

<p>We will take a walking tour and seek out public sites, noting the differences between public and private spaces. I want each of you to choose a public space, thing or institution to work with. What should everyone know about these sites? What and who is there? What is valuable or noteworthy? Who can you meet? How is the web currently a service or disservice to that space?</p>

<p>What is the difference between public and private? Make a list in small groups. What public institutions exist? Work together to expand the list of “Public …” phrases. As a group, we will make a list of what is public. And where should this go?
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zVYmPPERzy-PtCRwVjiVq2YaQQgL6DIRCCJAnx02W44/edit?usp=sharing">Put here for now.</a>
#thingsthatarepublic</p>

<h4 id="project-one">Project One</h4>

<p>Choose one of the following directions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pick a public site from our tour or the list being created, and create a website for it that will communicate to everyone (residents, predominantly) what you value of that public possession. How might you translate what you value about the public site to the web? What can the medium of the web (and by extension the Internet) do to help bring awareness to the original? Or might the website subvert, complicate or provide an alternative read of the public site chosen.</li>
  <li>The Providence government website takes a fairly expected approach. It organizes what it knows fairly efficiently so that its citizens (and potential citizens), may find information produced by the government. But this seems limiting. The essence of a city is that which changes, is mutable, changeable by the citizens themselves. There is the playground, but it’s those playing on the playground that define it as well. Using the city as inspiration, how might the web become more effected by its citizens? Something more dynamic, varied, dense. Clay Shirky’s view of Github comes to mind, a system for managing changes. This asks you to imagine a website that would make use of the media and stories created by citizens in a less hierarchical way. Not government pushed out…. but citizens bubbling up. We are in “the largest period of human expressive capability.”</li>
  <li>Make a project that is sited in the public space and would bring people together there</li>
</ul>

		        		<h1 id="the-web-and-democracy">The Web and Democracy</h1>

<p>Is the Internet making the world a better place or is it simply remaking the world – peacefully transferring capital from 20th century corporations to 21st century ones? If the digital space is becoming primary, then who is tending to the systems of self-government, defined so articulately in the age of Enlightenment?</p>

<p>This Web research elective asks students to design tools that further the public’s interest online. Can the Web – designed as an open and free medium – reinvigorate our investment in public space and the public good? Students will work together to engage politicians, non-profits, and fellow citizens in the pursuit of these questions.</p>

<p>Assignments will range from Web tools that serve democracy to civic fundraising to information dissemination. Class deliverables will be a combination of prototypes, presentations and coded mini-sites. Students will develop the parameters for the final project and work in teams. Outside collaborators and readings will enrich the conversation and the work. No previous web experience required, but Web Programming workshop strongly encouraged.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How do people organize themselves?</li>
  <li>Activity: What groups do you belong to?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unit-1-what-is-public">Unit 1: What is public?</h2>

<p>Every group shares objects, space, etc — a resource is called ‘public’ when it refers to something state-owned. How the group manages its resources and tends to what is common is critical to the vitality of the group. Democracy is an ideal system of government, but it is rarely justly applied. Who occupies public space in the U.S. has always been contentious. And how many of the institutions we deem public are still publicly owned and managed? This unit seeks to understand the state of our public possessions, in Providence specifically, and a desire to invest everyone within them. An abandonment of what is public is an abandonment of what holds the group together.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Where is the public? Lecture and city tour.</li>
  <li>Assignment 1</li>
</ul>

<!--
## Unit 2: The voting machine

Soliciting user feedback while developing software is useful. It's also central to democracy. What does a group of people think? What do they want? Voting machines are evolving technologies, with each machine introducing its own mechanical and human flaws – the butterfly ballot that cost Al Gore the 2000 Presidential election, as an example. What can designers learn from the research done on voting to aid their own process?


### Week 4: Oct 2, 2017

##### Reference / Readings

* Video Novello shared
* Brief lecture about government voting machines
* Look at more current technologies and hear about debacles: LA touch screen, IDEO
* Voter Field Guides, Center for Civic Design
* Black Mirror episode with game show voting


##### For next week


* *Assignment 2*: How does voting engage its constituents? How specific should questions be framed to get desired outcomes? Do voters remember their choices? Create an "election" for one of the constituencies that you belong to (a project, dorm, GD, RISD, etc). What are you trying to know? How should people vote? What are your goals for turnout? Include aspects of representative democracy (vote for a person or a proxy) and direct democracy (voting on issue where the outcome determined by majority).

##### Guests

* Dana Chisnell on how to solicit feedback

<h2 id="unit-2-from-private-to-public">Unit 2: From private to public</h2>

<p>Capitalism and democracy are strange bedfellows. Capitalism collects wealth and power, with that power seeking growth at all costs. In this unit, we seek how to divert our consumptive and creative attention away from private interests to the common good – to public interests. What can be learned from the tremendous innovation being funded by the private sector? How might innovations meant for ease and commerce be diverted into the social good in the form of tools, systems, and the like?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review  <em>Project 1</em></li>
  <li>Discuss unit 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Project Two: Visit the Providence City Council and propose a project based on the meeting. There are many things you could do (from augmented reality layers, to getting more people to attend, etc). Given the unit quesetion, consider how what the private sector has learned might work for the public.</p>

<h3 id="week-4-oct-9-2017">Week 4: Oct 9, 2017</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Share your findings from the Council meeting. Revise for next week.</li>

##### In-class Activity


##### For next week

* *Assignment 2: Part One: Research*: Visit at least two public libraries and familiarize yourself with their core systems. Get a library card, try to find material. See if various materials exist at your existing library versus the private sector, etc. Additionally, research the work of the private sector as it affects the library sector: Amazon, Google Books, Film/Video resources, etc.

* Go to the Providence City Council Oct. 5 meeting.

<h3 id="week-6-oct-16-2017">Week 6: Oct 16, 2017</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Generate questions for City Councilwomen Megan Kallman (Pawtucket) and Nirva LaFortune (Prov.)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unit-3-digital-to-physical">Unit 3: Digital to physical</h2>
<p>Can the Web, a “fast” medium (low effort, high volume), lead to “slower” more meaningful interactions/investments from constituents? In other words, how might the Web get someone off their screen and put their body alongside of others? Can the Web encourage participation from communities that tend to not participate in governance?</p>

<h2 id="unit-4-discussion-conversation-and-debate">Unit 4: Discussion, Conversation and Debate</h2>

<p>140 characters plus the like button have destroyed debate on the Internet. Early blogging felt more like publishing. How do we of differing opinions discuss now? How do you change someone’s mind? Can the Web facilitate this discussion, perhaps make the face-to-face discussion more palatable when it does happen. How do concerns over privacy affect free and open discussion?</p>

<h2 id="unit-5-open-assignment">Unit 5: Open Assignment</h2>

<p>The class will hone in on three to four projects. Discuss/vote and work in teams to scope and execute the project. The project should address the basic question: how can the web ameliorate democracy: to inform people, to encourage elevated discussion, participation… all the issues we’ve discussed over the semester. We will also discuss how to put together projects from the semester into a website for distribution.</p>

<h2 id="gradingassessment">Grading/Assessment</h2>

<p>Grades from A to F will be given at the end of the semester with the above criteria. This course is a required course that is seeking a certain level of competency with typography. The criteria above is meant to assess as objectively as possible a student’s proficiency in typography.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attendance (3rd absence fails the course)</li>
  <li>Participation to website and in class</li>
  <li>Motivation/Attitude</li>
  <li>Craftsmanship</li>
  <li>Depth of investigation</li>
  <li>Risk taking</li>
  <li>Teamwork and individual growth</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="diversitycivilitycitizenship">Diversity/Civility/Citizenship</h2>

<p>No learning can truly occur without accepting each other’s differences — those that we inherit and those that we choose. This course, this Department and this College thrive on self-expression. Students and faculty should feel comfortable using art and design as a means to understand themselves and their work. It is everyone’s responsibility to create an atmosphere of civility.</p>

<p>Additionally, juniors are expected to work in Design Center. Contributing to studio culture is an important part of being part of a community. Figure out ways to show your work to your peers between classes, whether informally or at certain points. You will learn as much from each other as you will from your teachers — there are 15 of you after all!</p>

<h2 id="collaborationplagiarismappropriation">Collaboration/Plagiarism/Appropriation</h2>
<p>All work is built upon other work; whether explicitly or not. In this course, there will be opportunities to work with your classmates to build something that is shared. Particularly with many deadlines and when learning a new skill, other people’s work may offer a pathway forward. What you do with what you see is important and can be the difference between riffing, appropriating, copying and stealing. As a general rule of thumb, if you see something you are excited about (in class or outside), understand the context in which it was made. What was the design responding to, communicating, and to whom. A deeper understanding of other people’s work generally produces additional ideas, realizations and starts to “fork” the idea (thank you, Github). It’s rare that your design problem is exactly like someone else’s. It is rare that you share the same values, interests, skills, as someone else. Referencing another person’s work can make sense (logo parodies, etc) if that fits your concept. In a school environment it’s best to check in with your teacher to see how to best make your own work truly your own.</p>
