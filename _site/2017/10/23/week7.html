<h3 id="write">Write:</h3>
<p>Take a position: write a single page of text with your position on crowdsourcing. Is it ever acceptable to crowd-source designs or to have the masses vote on designs created by discrete entities? Do your own reading as well. We will synthesize your writing into a single manifesto for posting. Put your writing in paragraphs where each paragraph is a point you’re trying to make.</p>

<p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>If you know any artists (including yourselves) interested in creating a logo for the Brown University Mindfulness Center, we have a competition going on now at <a href="https://99designs.com/">99designs.com</a> for $299. The link is <a href="https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/brown-university-mindfulness-center-launch-743623/brief#section-backgroundInformation">here</a>, and the first design drafts are due in four days. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who may be interested! It would be nice for us to have a personal connection to the designer.</p>

<p>Take care,</p>

<p>Eric</p>
