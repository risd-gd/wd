		In 1987 after the dissolution of the band Minor Threat, musician Ian Mackaye looked to start a new band focused on playing live music to bring forward his Punk and Do-It-Yourself politics.
	</p>


	<p class="main">
		The band consists of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally and drummer Brendan Canty.

		They toured for a year without recorded music in 1987.

	<p class="main">
		Fugazi's members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer's most loyal fans. Fugazi's inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band's members were debating the lowest profitable admission price.
	</p>


	<p class="main">		
		Fugazi's early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band's eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things.

		As Picciotto said, "You find the Elks Lodge, you find the guy who's got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen."

	<p class="main">
		Mackaye also created the DIY music label, Dischord Records, in 1980 as a means to remain independent from large corporate labels. Dischord supports other like minded bands such as <i>Rites of Spring, Youth Brigade, Government Issue, and Faith.</i>

		In a 1989 interview, Mackaye stated, "Im not gonna go out and try to get people to convert to hardcore or whatever. It seems disgusting to me that someone would try to sell something that means so much to them."
<!-- 
		In a separate interview, Mackaye states that, "Making money is many musicians art – not an art im interested in doing." -->
