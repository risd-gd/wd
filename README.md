# The Web and Democracy

Is the Internet making the world a better place or is it simply remaking the world – peacefully transferring capital from 20th century corporations to 21st century ones? If the digital space is becoming primary, then who is tending to the systems of self-government, defined so articulately in the age of Enlightenment?

This Web research elective asks students to design tools that further the public's interest online. Can the Web – designed as an open and free medium – reinvigorate our investment in public space and the public good? Students will work together to engage politicians, non-profits, and fellow citizens in the pursuit of these questions.

Assignments will range from Web tools that serve democracy to civic fundraising to information dissemination. Class deliverables will be a combination of prototypes, presentations and coded mini-sites. Students will develop the parameters for the final project and work in teams. Outside collaborators and readings will enrich the conversation and the work. No previous web experience required, but Web Programming workshop strongly encouraged.

## Introduction

### Week 1:  Sept 11, 2017


#### Opening lecture
<!--
* Democracy defined.
* Plato on why we form society
* Failures, possibilities, alternative models.
* The Web today versus its idealistic state
* Democracy today versus its idealistic state
* How does a government differ from a private company? (Terms of service?)
-->

#### Review Syllabus

#### Who are we?

* Introduce ourselves
* Activity: "To what groups do you belong, and how do those groups organize themselves?"

#### How might democratic ideals be improved (in government, organizations, etc) using the Web and technology?

As a class we will collect what we know about this topic and see how to best to organize it for others by the end of the semester. As part of this, each of you will contribute a presentation, in web form, to the rest of the class.

Choose an organization from the below list (or add your own) and research how the group organizes itself. Each of the following makes use of various democratic principles: representatives, voting, decentralized labor, etc. Create a single serve website that you can present to the class that communicates how the group organizes itself. Who does the work? What are the benefits and drawbacks to its structure? What are the rules? Who has a stake? What makes it special? How can we learn from it?  

* Quaker Community
* The Dirt Palace
* The Boy Scouts
* Burning Man Festival
* The Green Bay Packers
* The w3c
* Fugazi
* Wikipedia
* Vanguard
* Park Slope Food Coop
* Linux

#### Creation of class pact

* How might the class structure itself support, reinforce or play with the central ideas of the course. Do we form a constitution? How much of what we do is public/online? What do we want in our GitHub repo? As a browsable site? Does majority rule?


## Unit 1: Investing in the Public
<!--
How are members in a group informed about key decisions or proposed changes to the group? How might the web reach those who sit at the margins of any democratic process -- particularly when it comes time to vote, voice support or opposition to civic and state matters, etc? Those in the minority, immigrants, and the poor do not benefit equally from democratic ideals and processes. How might the Web reach these people? How might it acknowledge their perspectives? What information is available and how might it effectively reach all constituents? What does a group of people think about issues, and how might that inform policy directly?
-->

No matter which group you are a part of, there is are common things -- defined as 'public' when it refers to state-owned. How the group manages, tends to what is common is critical to the vitality of the group. An abandonment of what is public is an abandonment of what holds the groups together. Who public space was for in the U.S. has always been contentious. This unit seeks to understand the state of publicness, in Providence specifically, and a desire to invest those within it.


### Week 1: Sept 11, 2017

We will take a walking tour and seek out public sites, noting the differences between public and private spaces. I want each of you to choose a public space, thing or institution to work with. What should everyone know about these sites? What and who is there? What is valuable or noteworthy? Who can you meet? How is the web currently a service or disservice to that space?


Difference between public and private? Make a list in small groups, add to master list. Public is shared, Public is transparent, etc. What public institutions exist? Work together to expand the list of "Public ..." phrases. As a group, we will make a list of what is public. Where should this go?  #thingsthatarepublic


#### Project One

Choose one of the following directions.

* Pick a public place, thing, institution, from our tour or the list being created, and create a website for it that will communicate to everyone (residents, predominantly) the value of that public possession. How might you translate what you value about the public site to its web site?
* The Providence government website takes a fairly expected approach. It organizes what it knows fairly efficiently so that its citizens (and potential citizens), may find information produced by the government. But this seems limiting. The essence of a city is that which changes, is mutable, changeable by the citizens themselves. There is the playground, but it's those playing on the playground that define it as well. Using the city as inspiration, how might the website for the City become more effected by its citizens? Something more dynamic, varied, dense. Clay Shirky's view of Github comes to mind, a system for managing changes. This asks you to imagine a website that would make use of the media and stories created by citizens in a less hierarchical way. Not government pushed out.... but citizens bubbling up, following Clay Shirky's networked culture.

## Unit 2: The voting machine

Soliciting user feedback while developing software is useful. It's also central to democracy. What does a group of people think? What do they want? Voting machines are evolving technologies, with each machine introducing its own mechanical and human flaws – the butterfly ballot that cost Al Gore the 2000 Presidential election, as an example. What can designers learn from the research done on voting to aid their own process?


### Week 4: Oct 2, 2017

##### Reference / Readings

* Video Novello shared
* Brief lecture about government voting machines
* Look at more current technologies and hear about debacles: LA touch screen, IDEO
* Voter Field Guides, Center for Civic Design
* Black Mirror episode with game show voting


##### For next week


* *Assignment 2*: How does voting engage its constituents? How specific should questions be framed to get desired outcomes? Do voters remember their choices? Create an "election" for one of the constituencies that you belong to (a project, dorm, GD, RISD, etc). What are you trying to know? How should people vote? What are your goals for turnout? Include aspects of representative democracy (vote for a person or a proxy) and direct democracy (voting on issue where the outcome determined by majority).

##### Guests

* Dana Chisnell on how to solicit feedback

## Unit 2: From private to public

Capitalism and democracy are strange bedfellows. Capitalism collects wealth and power, with that power seeking growth at all costs. In this unit, we seek how to divert our consumptive and creative attention away from private interests to the common good – to public interests. What can be learned from the tremendous innovation being funded by the private sector? How might innovations meant for ease and commerce be diverted into the social good in the form of tools, systems, and the like?

### Week 4: Oct 2, 2017

* Review  *Project 1*
* Discuss unit 2

Project Two: Visit the Providence City Council and propose a project based on the meeting. There are many things you could do (from augmented reality layers, to getting more people to attend, etc). Given the unit quesetion, consider how what the private sector has learned might work for the public.

### Week 4: Oct 9, 2017
* Share your findings from the Council meeting. Revise for next week.

<!--
##### Discussion / References

* To come

##### In-class Activity


##### For next week

* *Assignment 2: Part One: Research*: Visit at least two public libraries and familiarize yourself with their core systems. Get a library card, try to find material. See if various materials exist at your existing library versus the private sector, etc. Additionally, research the work of the private sector as it affects the library sector: Amazon, Google Books, Film/Video resources, etc.

* Go to the Providence City Council Oct. 5 meeting.

-->

### Week 6: Oct 16, 2017

* Generate questions for City Councilwomen Megan Kallman (Pawtucket) and Nirva LaFortune (Prov.)


## Unit 3: Digital to physical
Can the Web, a "fast" medium (low effort, high volume), lead to "slower" more meaningful interactions/investments from constituents? In other words, how might the Web get someone off their screen and put their body alongside of others? Can the Web encourage participation from communities that tend to not participate in governance?

## Unit 4: Discussion, Conversation and Debate

140 characters plus the like button have destroyed debate on the Internet. Early blogging felt more like publishing. How do we of differing opinions discuss now? How do you change someone's mind? Can the Web facilitate this discussion, perhaps make the face-to-face discussion more palatable when it does happen. How do concerns over privacy affect free and open discussion?

## Unit 5: Open Assignment

The class will hone in on three to four projects. Discuss/vote and work in teams to scope and execute the project. The project should address the basic question: how can the web ameliorate democracy: to inform people, to encourage elevated discussion, participation... all the issues we've discussed over the semester. We will also discuss how to put together projects from the semester into a website for distribution.


### Class review on Week 12: Dec 4, 2017; Project delivery by Dec 11, 2017

## Grading/Assessment

Grades from A to F will be given at the end of the semester with the above criteria. This course is a required course that is seeking a certain level of competency with typography. The criteria above is meant to assess as objectively as possible a student’s proficiency in typography.

* Attendance (3rd absence fails the course)
* Participation to website and in class
* Motivation/Attitude
* Craftsmanship
* Depth of investigation
* Risk taking
* Teamwork and individual growth


## Diversity/Civility/Citizenship

No learning can truly occur without accepting each other’s differences — those that we inherit and those that we choose. This course, this Department and this College thrive on self-expression. Students and faculty should feel comfortable using art and design as a means to understand themselves and their work. It is everyone’s responsibility to create an atmosphere of civility.

Additionally, juniors are expected to work in Design Center. Contributing to studio culture is an important part of being part of a community. Figure out ways to show your work to your peers between classes, whether informally or at certain points. You will learn as much from each other as you will from your teachers — there are 15 of you after all!


## Collaboration/Plagiarism/Appropriation
All work is built upon other work; whether explicitly or not. In this course, there will be opportunities to work with your classmates to build something that is shared. Particularly with many deadlines and when learning a new skill, other people’s work may offer a pathway forward. What you do with what you see is important and can be the difference between riffing, appropriating, copying and stealing. As a general rule of thumb, if you see something you are excited about (in class or outside), understand the context in which it was made. What was the design responding to, communicating, and to whom. A deeper understanding of other people’s work generally produces additional ideas, realizations and starts to “fork” the idea (thank you, Github). It’s rare that your design problem is exactly like someone else’s. It is rare that you share the same values, interests, skills, as someone else. Referencing another person’s work can make sense (logo parodies, etc) if that fits your concept. In a school environment it’s best to check in with your teacher to see how to best make your own work truly your own.
