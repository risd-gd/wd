<div id="question">
<p>  
What is your stance regarding America's obsession with firearms, and its seemingly ingrained connection to our country.
By extension of that, do you believe that increased gun control is a necessity in a market that is fairly fluid and open.
What is your position on the lack of laws in Rhode Island limiting the number of guns that can be owned per hosehold. 
Finally, do you think there should be a larger legal response to the current more relaxed concealed carry laws in Rhode Island.
