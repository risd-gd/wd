The process of the ecotherapy is not done by professionals but by the physical and mental interaction among people and the nature around the bike path. Mechanisms such as card collecting and therapy instructions are given to enhance the user experience. An app dedicated for constructing the bike path experience as well as a website promoting the idea were made.
