The goal is to increase the awareness of the public site as well as bringing more values from the site to the public. With this project, more people should aware of the fact that the bike path brings a great opportunity for people to be with the nature and release their stress.


The project provides a platform encouraging people to spend their time on the bike path by establishing an ecotherapy service from the site. The process of the ecotherapy is not done by professionals but by the physical and mental interaction among people and the nature around the bike path. Mechanisms such as card collecting and therapy instructions are given to enhance the user experience. An app dedicated for constructing the bike path experience as well as a website promoting the idea were made.
