Below you will find links to the projects I have been working on for the last semester!

UNIT ONE:

We were asssigned with looking into the concept of public space, what exactly is it? and where can we find it. As an avid cyclist I began to think about the idea of perpetual moving public space. As a bike rider you inhabit a public space in motion and often people in their cars begin to obstruct that public space you have have acquired, also known as the 3 feet rule. For week one, I created a website to focus in on some critial aspects of Rhode Island bike laws. The website is seen as a tool or a resource page to spread the knowledge of safe riding.

When revisiting my concept for week two, I wanted to work with data and a stronger message. In the time that I had I wanted to create visuals for data that was previosuly difficult to find online or simply not discussed.

If I were to expand on this project I might pair it up with a twitter bot or some mechanism that could aggregate data and work on its own to spread the message.

UNIT TWO:

Online division three soccer ownership group based in Japan. Fujeida MYFC has a very unique rise in the soccer world, once being saved by onlne crowd funding. link to project-->
