### Delivery of work
As discussed last week, you may revise/update/refine your [projects from this semester](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AG-2qu-_MdPaCHiu9yTRA_C7Ftkpl4C0l8C08vJH_tw) and should commit the work to our GitHub repository in a folder of your name. If projects rely on external servers or cannot be added to the Repo, they may reside in another publicly accessible place. Create a post that links to your projects as well with titles, descriptions and screenshots for each project. Group projects may appear multiple times, but be sure to include.

Work should be completed by Thursday, Dec 14, 8am unless cleared by instructor.
