## Schedule

* Show GitHub, Jekyll and Bindery
* Meet in small groups about projects
* 11am talk and activity by Ryan Laughlin
* Based on what Ryan shows us. Either take some thing from Providence Open Data and turn it into a form that people would benefit from or collect data from your public site and imagine it on the site. Create your own data source that tells something about the community you live in.
