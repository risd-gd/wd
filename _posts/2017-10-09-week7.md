### Write:
Take a position: write a single page of text with your position on crowdsourcing. Is it ever acceptable to crowd-source designs or to have the masses vote on designs created by discrete entities? Do your own reading as well. We will synthesize your writing into a single manifesto for posting. Put your writing in paragraphs where each paragraph is a point you're trying to make.

### Add to Untitled Park post

Dear friends,

If you know any artists (including yourselves) interested in creating a logo for the Brown University Mindfulness Center, we have a competition going on now at [99designs.com](https://99designs.com/) for $299. The link is [here](https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/brown-university-mindfulness-center-launch-743623/brief#section-backgroundInformation), and the first design drafts are due in four days. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who may be interested! It would be nice for us to have a personal connection to the designer.

Take care,

Eric




## Notes
- Physical materials a big deal in communicating with people.
- Email vs . Annual communication.... Who is your councilperson... A lot of informal communication ....
- There is conversation before meetings
-
