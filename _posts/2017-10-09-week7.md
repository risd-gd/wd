## Plan
* Entrance ticket: Nirva and Meghan conversation recap. Email them both and thank them for coming (mention something specifically that they said or helped you understand). Email addresses in Slack.



* On the sharing document. What happened? How to focus it some more.
* Crowdsourcing
  * Ian Lynam piece on [Tokyo identity](https://medium.com/@ianlynam/why-we-should-really-be-concerned-about-the-visual-identity-for-the-tokyo-olympics-969830d0e819)
  * I voted logo [contest](https://www.fastcodesign.com/90124343/10-new-designs-for-the-i-voted-sticker)
  * "Contest" for RI sticker [tweet](https://twitter.com/JohnMarionjr/status/918881704147914752)
  * Recent email from [Brown prof](#one)
  * Take a position: write a single page of text with your position on crowdsourcing. Is it ever acceptable to crowd-source designs or to have the masses vote on designs created by discrete entities? Do your own reading as well. We will synthesize your writing into a single manifesto for posting.
* Look at progress on city council project
* Single serve flag site [based on Ds1](http://ds1-2017.risd.gd/#Unit 3)
* "We share" website...


## Presentations

## Upcoming

* Oct. 30: Visit by John Marion of [Common Cause RI](http://commoncauseri.org/) and Jodi Leo on a digital "I voted" sticker
* Four classes left thereafter: Nov 6, Nov 13, Nov 27, Dec 4

Dear friends,

If you know any artists (including yourselves) interested in creating a logo for the Brown University Mindfulness Center, we have a competition going on now at [99designs.com](https://99designs.com/) for $299. The link is [here](https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/brown-university-mindfulness-center-launch-743623/brief#section-backgroundInformation), and the first design drafts are due in four days. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who may be interested! It would be nice for us to have a personal connection to the designer.

Take care,

Eric




## Notes
- Physical materials a big deal in communicating with people.
- Email vs . Annual communication.... Who is your councilperson... A lot of informal communication ....
- There is conversation before meetings
-
