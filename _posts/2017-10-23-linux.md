Dear friends,

If you know any artists (including yourselves) interested in creating a logo for the Brown University Mindfulness Center, we have a competition going on now at [99designs.com](https://99designs.com/) for $299. The link is [here](https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/brown-university-mindfulness-center-launch-743623/brief#section-backgroundInformation), and the first design drafts are due in four days. Please feel free to forward this to anyone who may be interested! It would be nice for us to have a personal connection to the designer.

Take care,

Eric
