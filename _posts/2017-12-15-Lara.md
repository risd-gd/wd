-> Light Pollution

This website serves to inform its visitors about the effects of artificial light pollution facing all living things on earth, including us. For billions of years, all life has relied on Earthâ€™s predictable rhythm of day and night. Humans have radically disrupted this cycle by lighting up the night. Cities across the globe are converting their existing street lighting to blue-rich white LED (including Providence, RI). They expect the new lighting will remain in service for several decades. Time is running out to influence the decisions and prevent outcomes that are bad for people, plants, wildlife and the night sky. This site includes many links to further research and findings on the topic. Both web and mobile version.
