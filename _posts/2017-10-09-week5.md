## Plan

* Submit by then documentation (or URL) of your first project along with a paragraph explaining what the project is about (its intentions, audience, how it satisfies project goals, etc). Put your projects in Slack so others can see (general?).

* We’ll see Miro’s presentation and website

Let’s talk/look at private sector inventions and see how they might help the City Council project…

Let’s prep for Nirva/Meghan Kallman event…

Time to deal with our own website!

* Tool to enable democratic decisions in GD, at schools, etc
* The way we make a site (or use the web). Decentralized. Like 2nd option from assignment 1
* Push out what we've learned/made (content is important)
